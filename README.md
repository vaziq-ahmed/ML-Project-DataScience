# 📊 End-to-End Machine Learning Project – Data Science Pipeline

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project is a complete **End-to-End Machine Learning pipeline** built using **Python** and **industry-standard best practices**.  
It covers the full ML lifecycle — from **data ingestion** to **model training**, **evaluation**, and **prediction deployment using Flask**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **real-world Data Science & ML engineering skills**, including modular coding, exception handling, logging, and production-ready structure.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Modular and scalable project structure
- Custom exception and logging system
- Data ingestion, transformation, and model training pipelines
- Model serialization using `dill`
- Prediction pipeline for inference
- Flask-based backend for model prediction
- Follows real industry ML project architecture

## 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion
- Reads raw dataset from source
- Splits data into train and test sets
- Stores datasets in `artifacts/`

### 2️⃣ Data Transformation
- Handles missing values
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Saves preprocessing object for reuse

### 3️⃣ Model Training
- Trains machine learning models
- Evaluates model performance
- Saves best-performing model

### 4️⃣ Prediction Pipeline
- Loads trained model and preprocessor
- Accepts new input data
- Generates predictions

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaziq-ahmed/ML-Project-DataScience.git
cd ML-Project-DataScience

## 💡 Recruiter-friendly tips (optional but powerful)
If you want, next we can:
- Add **screenshots**
- Add **API endpoint documentation**
- Add **sample input & output**
- Add **model metrics (accuracy, RMSE, etc.)**
- Make it **ATS-optimized for resumes**

Just tell me what you want to improve next — this README already puts you ahead of most candidates 🚀💼
